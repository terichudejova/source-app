✔ Use of HTML, SCSS, JS, and the React and MUI libraries<br/>
✔ SCSS includes variables, mixins, and other elements<br/>
✔ Website responsiveness<br/>
✔ Client-side routing for navigating between website sections<br/>
✔ React hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useNavigate, useParams, useContext, useCallback, useLocation...<br/>
✔ Working with REST API<br/><br/>

In each section, I demonstrate:<br/><br/>

**External API:** Using asynchronous axios GET, I work with three APIs. Two of them return values directly, while the third processes an input value and returns a specific result based on a combination of an API and a local file (data/nationalities.json).<br/>
**Local Storage:** A shopping list with item filtering, where items and their associated values are saved in Local Storage. This ensures they remain stored even after refreshing the page.<br/>
**Registration:** Two forms – the first sends data to Google Forms using fetch, while the second validates the username and password (using REGEX), displays conditional icons/instructions, and after successful registration, saves the data with axios into data/registration.json (port 4000).<br/>
**Local API:** This section demonstrates the use of both fetch and axios with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods. In addition to fetching and displaying blog posts, you can add a new post, edit it, or delete it directly through the UI (port 3500, data/db.json file).<br/>
**Status Management:** An example of passing state between React components – the state changed in component C is updated in components A and B as well.<br/>
